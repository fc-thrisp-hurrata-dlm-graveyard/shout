Shout is an imageboard-forum application in Rails3

There is an admin section for creating forums located at /admin/forums (currently not authenticated in any way, shape, or form.)

Suggestions and participation encouraged. Right now, this IS a mess in progress. 

The original git repo was nuked and started over, see CHANGELOG for some history.


Immediate:
 
  - user and vote models
  - session management
  /- session based delete of items you posted
  - reporting

 
  
Eventually:
  
  - incorporate js
  - slicker css/html
  - endless paging, remove pagination
  - Clean-up collapsed Shout model
  - AmazonS3 storage for images
  - Freeze gif display
  /- delete shout -- based on session info - you posted, you delete
  /- reporting options
  - admin sticky shout
  - cleaner forms
  - Admin authentication
  - API for posting
  - separate post / image into two models #why has this been so difficulttttt for me #ah, carrierwave has/had nested issues


Think about:
     
  - cdn
  - caching 
  - Separate forum/shout logic from admin logic (only aliased it seems, cannot remove some methods from forum without disrupting admin/forum)
  - Expanded admin options (list all shouts, list all images, list all comments e.g. for deletion or bans)
  - Expanded models -- video uploads perhaps, gathering info for spam prevention/ban
  - Tagging images, filtering (perhaps not for a simple imageboard -- tagging is there, but unused right now.)  
  - Fix carrierwave ':auto_validation => false' model requirement (needed or it works but spews errors on image uploads)
  - Hashing images  --> possible caching/duplicate prevention
  - Text filtering
  - Processing of submitted text:filters, perhaps a robot/daemon that enforces unique text, filtering out url posting
  - Image/Shout expiration, auto clearing of folders/db
  - Limited markup for shout text, input sanitation
